                My dearest,
            </p>

            <p>
                Where do I even begin? You've become the most important part of my life, 
                and I find myself grateful every single day that you exist, that you're here with me.
            </p>

            <p>
                I love the way you laugh, that genuine, laugh that makes everything feel right 
                in the world. I love your kindness, 
                your strength, and the way you see beauty in things I might have otherwise missed.
            </p>

            <p>
                You make me want to be better. You inspire me to dream bigger and believe in myself more. 
                With you, I feel like I can do anything. You're not just my love you're my best friend, 
                my safe place, my home.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every moment with you is precious to me, from the quiet moments to the silly ones. 
                The way you listen when I talk (most of the time), the way you make me feel seen 
                and understood, it all means the world to me.
            </p>

            <p>
                I promise to love you with all my heart, to support your dreams, to be there for you 
                in every season of life. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I'm so honored 
                to be the one walking alongside you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for being you. Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for all the love and light 
                you bring into my life.
            </p>
